            <p id="p1"><strong>Brandy Dowl</strong> had always loved cool Docks Harlem with its lazy, light Lake. It was
                a place where he felt
                nervous.

                He was a naive, cheerful, beer drinker with masculine hair and handsome arms. His friends saw him as a
                wet, whispering warrior. Once, he had even helped a snotty old man recover from a flying accident.
                That's the sort of man he was.

                Brandy walked over to the window and reflected on his great surroundings. The breezy teased like running
                dogs.

                Then he saw something in the distance, or rather someone. It was the figure of May April. May was a
                charming lively with beautiful hair and tall arms.

                Brandy gulped. He was not prepared for May. <br><br>

                As Brandy stepped outside and May came closer, he could see the alert smile on her face.

                May gazed with the affection of 4964 religious adventurous antelopes. She said, in hushed tones, "I love
                you and I want romance."

                Brandy looked back, even more courage and still fingering the hot shield. "May, I wanna be with you," he
                replied.

                They looked at each other with happy feelings, like two brief, beautiful boars training at a very strong
                party, which had piano music playing in the background and two intelligent uncles caring to the beat.
                <br><br>

                Brandy regarded May's beautiful hair and tall arms. "I feel the same way!" revealed Brandy with a
                delighted grin.

                May looked tense, her emotions blushing like a curved, crooked club.

                Then May came inside for a nice drink of beer. <br><br>

                <em>THE END</em>

            The term story generator algorithms (SGAs) refers to computational procedures resulting in an artifact that
            can be considered a story. In the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI), the automated generation of stories
            has been a subject of research for over fifty years. An algorithm is understood as a set of instructions
            that, when applied to a given input, produces an output. In the present context, the desired output is a
            story. The underlying concept of “story” in SGAs is functional and does not imply any aesthetic notion. This
            is important because it sets the context for evaluation of generated stories, for which having a surface
            realization as a readable and appealing text is not necessarily a core issue.[9]

            GPT-2 (2019) could be used to generate stories, if given appropriate prompts.[10] "TalkToTransformer.com",
            released later that year, offered an accessible front-end to the public to use GPT-2's technology to
            generate stories.[11] AI Dungeon, also layered on GPT-2, debuted in December 2019, and by August 2020
            reportedly claimed over a million active monthly users.[12]

                Plot generators were described as early as the late 1920s, with Plotto; a new method of plot suggestion
                for writers of creative fiction, by William Wallace Cook, appearing in 1928.[1] Plotto is a non-random
                plot generator; the reader makes all the decisions within the framework set out by the book.[2]
                In an article originally published in 1935 and reprinted in 2002, Robert J. Hogan described a book-based
                device called the Plot Genie which consisted of three lists of 180 items each: murder victims in the
                first list, crime locations in the second list, and important clues in the third list. The item to use
                from each list was chosen by spinning a dial with 180 numbers on it. <br>

                Plot Genie (formally Plot Robot)
                was developed over the course of sixteen years by Wycliffe, A. Hill and published around 1931. Hogan
                also mentions other similar devices such as The 36 Dramatic Situations (described by Polti in 1895, who
                claims to have improved on the work of Carlo Gozzi, 1720 to 1806) and Plotto (see above).[3][4]
                The earliest computerized story generator was TALE-SPIN, an artificial intelligence program developed in
                the 1970s.[5][6] More recently in the 1990s, the computer program MEXICA was developed for academic
                research into automated plot generation. It produces plots related to the Mexica people.[7] Using an
                approach similar to that of MEXICA, the program ProtoPropp generates stories related to Russian
                folklore.[8] There are a large number of "random plot generators" available on the internet—generic and
                relating to specific fandoms, with a certain amount of academic research into the subject.

            <h3><em>Quotes About Plot Generator</em></h3> <br>
            <ul>
                <li><q>This is the best thing to exist ever.</q></li>
                <li><q>So I used a generator to create a random story and it turned out to be hilarious.</q></li>
                <li><q>This is fun. A little silly. It tried a few variations and got some very quirky results. It might
                        be
                        good for a little inspiration, as a writing exercise, or if you're bored.</q></li>
                <li><q>Plot Generator is really best if used completely randomly (press 'fill in) and see what happens.
                        We got
                        a completely zany storyline that included robots poking each other.</q></li>

            1. Choose a theme from our selection of plot generators.

        <p style="text-align: justify;">
            Wikipedia[c] is a free-content online encyclopedia written and maintained by a community of volunteers,
            known
            as Wikipedians, through open collaboration and the wiki software MediaWiki. Wikipedia is the largest and
            most-read reference work in history,[3][4] and is consistently ranked among the ten most visited websites;
            as of December 2024, it was ranked fifth by Semrush,[5] and seventh by Similarweb.[6] Founded by Jimmy Wales
            and Larry Sanger on January 15, 2001, Wikipedia has been hosted since 2003 by the Wikimedia Foundation, an
            American nonprofit organization funded mainly by donations from readers.[7]

            Initially only available in English, Wikipedia now exists in more than 300 languages. The English Wikipedia,
            with over 6 million articles, remains the largest of the editions, which together comprise more than 64
            million articles and attract more than 1.5 billion unique device visits and 13 million edits per month
            (about 5 edits per second on average) as of April 2024.[W 1] As of November 2024, over 25% of Wikipedia's
            traffic was from the United States, followed by Japan at 6.2%, the United Kingdom at 5.6%, Russia at 5.0%,
            Germany at 4.8%, and the remaining 53.3% split among other countries.[8]

            Wikipedia has been praised for its enablement of the democratization of knowledge, extent of coverage,
            unique structure, and culture. Wikipedia has been censored by some national governments, ranging from
            specific pages to the entire site.[9][10] Although Wikipedia's volunteer editors have written extensively on
            a wide variety of topics, the encyclopedia has been criticized for systemic bias, such as a gender bias
            against women and geographical bias against the Global South (Eurocentrism).[11][12] While the reliability
            of Wikipedia was frequently criticized in the 2000s, it has improved over time, receiving greater praise
            from the late 2010s onward[3][13][14] while becoming an important fact-checking site.[15][16] Articles on
            breaking news are often accessed as sources for frequently updated information about those events.[17][18]
